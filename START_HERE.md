## 🎯 What You Need to Do NOW

### **STEP 1: Import the Workflow (2 minutes)**

1. Open your browser
2. Go to: **http://localhost:5678**
3. Click **"Add workflow"** (top right)
4. Click **"Import from file"**
5. Select: **`TYSON_DOC_ANALYZER_3000.json`** (on your Desktop)
6. Click **Open**

### **STEP 2: Activate It (10 seconds)**

1. Look for the **toggle switch** in the top-right corner
2. Click it to **ACTIVATE** the workflow
3. It should turn **blue/green** and say "Active"

### **STEP 3: Test It (1 minute)**

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
cd ~/Projects/n8n-production/tests
./quick_test.sh
```

**You should see:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "documentId": "DOC-...",
  "processed": {
    "type": "invoice",
    "confidence": 95
  },
  "storage": {
    "database": true,
    "archive": true
  }
}
```

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

**"Webhook not found" error?**
→ You forgot to ACTIVATE the workflow (Step 2)

**"Connection refused"?**
→ N8N isn't running. It should be running in the background.

**"Import failed"?**
→ Make sure you're importing `TYSON_DOC_ANALYZER_3000.json`

---

## 🚀 After Testing Successfully

Run the full test suite:
```bash
cd ~/Projects/n8n-production/tests
./test_workflow.sh
```

Check the database:
```bash
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/postgresql@15/15.14/bin/psql -d document_analyzer
# Then type: SELECT * FROM processed_documents;
```

View archived files:
```bash
ls -lR ~/Projects/n8n-production/archives/
```
